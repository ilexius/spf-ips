* Get all SPF-related IPs for a specific domain

  This tool provides a way to query all IPs related to the SPF entry
  of a specific domain:
  #+begin_example
    $ get_spf_ips gmail.com
    172.217.0.0/19
    216.239.32.0/19
    216.58.192.0/19
    209.85.128.0/17
    207.126.144.0/20
    173.194.0.0/16
    108.177.8.0/21
    74.125.0.0/16
    72.14.192.0/18
    66.249.80.0/20
    66.102.0.0/20
    64.233.160.0/19
    64.18.0.0/20
  #+end_example

  This is done by recursively querying the TXT entries of the
  domain. For example, you can see that the first IPs printed above
  are extracted from something like the following:
  #+begin_example
    $ dig TXT gmail.com | grep 'v=spf1'
    gmail.com.              225     IN      TXT     "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.google.com"

    $ dig TXT _spf.google.com | grep 'v=spf1'
    _spf.google.com.        161     IN      TXT     "v=spf1 include:_netblocks.google.com include:_netblocks2.google.com include:_netblocks3.google.com ~all"

    $ dig TXT _netblocks.google.com | grep 'v=spf1'
    _netblocks.google.com.  553     IN      TXT     "v=spf1 ip4:64.18.0.0/20 ip4:64.233.160.0/19 ip4:66.102.0.0/20 ip4:66.249.80.0/20 ip4:72.14.192.0/18 ip4:74.125.0.0/16 ip4:108.177.8.0/21 ip4:173.194.0.0/16 ip4:207.126.144.0/20 ip4:209.85.128.0/17 ip4:216.58.192.0/19 ip4:216.239.32.0/19 ~all"
  #+end_example

  ~get_spf_ips~ is known to work for ~gmail.com~ and ~outlook.com~.

  NOTE: As of this writing this tool does not provide sorting and
  deduplicaton of IP addresses. Also note that only IPv4 addresses
  will be provided.
